# basic_user_app

install npm & mongo
create db = users, collection = accounts

this branch is the first method of implementing multi-language

in language.json, each string has an english & nihongo version

in angular, call the variable then add [current_language]

pros:
    english & nihongo texts are adjacent, easier search & edit per text
cons:
    use of [current_language] in all variables in angular
